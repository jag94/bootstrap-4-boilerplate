                        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet- is how one would normally leave a template page. However, that would
                        be a bit counterproductive in learning a subject. There isn't really much else to say here. I
                        hope everyone is doing well during this outbreak. I know that I personally have not been doing
                        too well. All things considered though, I am alive and on my way to good health. People have
                        been lost on the way to this point, but there is much hope for recovery. Hopefully this ends
                        before it manages to get much worse and I wish anyone who reads this good luck in the future..
