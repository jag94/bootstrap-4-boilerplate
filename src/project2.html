                        Though this isn't exactly my first website, it is my first semester utilising Github and
                        Javascript together like this. At the end of the day, the content is relatively the same,
                        however the execution is always a bit different and I find it interesting how the different
                        methods work. Some code looks almost identical across languages, which is helpful, but others
                        have very many ways to do just about the same thing. This semester has really shown me that.
